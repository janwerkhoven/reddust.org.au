      <h2>Become a workplace giving partner today!</h2>
      <p class="center">Workplace giving is where employees give small, regular donations to a charity from their pre-tax pay. It’s a simple and effective way to make the world a better place.</p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p class="center">Through workplace giving, employees can nominate Red Dust to receive a regular donation taken from their salary before tax each pay cycle!<br>
        Employers make the donation directly to Red Dust, and in some cases match the employee donation dollar for dollar.<br>
        As donations are deducted from pre–tax pay, the tax benefit for the employee is immediate and there is no need to keep receipts or claim at tax time.<br>
        Workplace giving is one of the most effective ways of supporting us to strengthen the future of Indigenous youth and families in remote communities.</p>
