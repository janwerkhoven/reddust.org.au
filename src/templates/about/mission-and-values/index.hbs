      <h2>Mission &amp; values</h2>
      <p>Generations of Indigenous Australians in remote communities have lived a life impacted by poor health. This affects the whole community, especially young people. Red Dust believes that good health is the key to a bright future and that health outcomes can only be made possible through a two-way exchange with communities.</p>
