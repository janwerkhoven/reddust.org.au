        <p>Red Dust’s unique approach to achieving health outcomes is working. We partner with communities to best target specific local needs – this is not a one size fits all approach. We encourage Indigenous youth to learn more about health by using channels
          they respond to such as sport, art, music and dance. We improve knowledge and skills of Indigenous youth and inspire them to live a healthy lifestyle through the influence of positive role models.</p>

              <h2>Healthy Living is a school-based health development program delivered through three stages of week-long visits to schools in remote communities.</h2>
              <p>
                Healthy Living utilises sport, art, music and dance to drive its messages resulting in fun, interactive and inclusive classroom activities. Role Models from sport, art, music, dance, business and health provide the expertise to support the delivery of
                Healthy Living. Students learn the essential elements to good health including nutrition, hygiene, substance misuse and physical activity. Learning outcomes range from the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables to the definition and
                causes of common preventable diseases. Students are encouraged to be creative and learn new skills in sport, the arts and healthy cooking while interacting with role models.

                Typically, the facilitator begins a theme or subject for discussion with his own story and asks the other men in the group to share their own experiences and ideas on the subject. This is a powerful time of sharing (either in English, traditional language
                or a combination of both) where Aboriginal men can share their individual journeys, relate to other men around similar experiences and feel safe and supported by the group. </p>

              <h2>Why focus on Aboriginal Male Health?</h2>
              <p>
                Statistically, Life expectancy for Aboriginal males in Australia is estimated at 18 years less than non-Aboriginal men on average (59 years for Aboriginal men versus 77 years for non-Aboriginal men). There is also a 6 year gap in life expectancy between
                Aboriginal men and Aboriginal women (59 years and 65 years respectively) Emerging data confirms that Aboriginal men have the worst health outcomes of any subgroup in Australia. The data clearly indicates that Aboriginal men’s health and
                wellbeing is not going well at the moment. Aboriginal men die earlier from chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, injury, respiratory disease, cancer and endocrine disease. They have higher rates of suicide than non-Aboriginal
                men, and have similar death rates from assault to females.</p>
